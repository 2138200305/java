	<!-- What in the blueblazes is javascript? 
	A programming/scripting language originally designed to provide
	functionality to web pages; effectively making those web
	pages dynamic. Allows code to be run client side
	as well instead of JUST server side.
	
	Everytime you see a webpage that does more than JUST display
	static content, then you're more than likely looking at javascript
	creating that functionality. JS does things like displaying timely
	content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
	scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
	
	While JS was designed to be a scripting language, popularity drove
	it to become a full programming language. Today,  entire servers
	can be written in JS. For example, Node.js is a server that runs
	JS code.
	
	Features of JS:
		-loosely typed (a variable can hold a value of any datatype)
		-it's a dynamic language (you can modify objects at runtime)
		-just in time (JIT) compiler
		   js is not compiled, it is interpreted
		-originally build for DOM manipulation, but it has evolved
		-generally, interpreted by the browser
			(Chrome's V8 engine, Firefox's spidermonkey engine etc)
