Welcome to eZoo!

In this project, you'll be exposed to several Java technologies that you'll use to build a simple web application. 

This project is setup to host small lecture videos that will present a concept or code examples that will help you perform a particular function in the project. It is best to follow along with your development tools as you can to get the most out of the videos. 

After a video, you'll then have either a quiz or coding activity to complete. Coding activities will provide you hands-on experience at developing a section of the project and quizzes are meant to reinforce particular subjects presented in the videos. You have unlimited attempts to submit a quiz, so aim to learn as much from the questions presented. Note, that some quizzes have multiple questions, so different attempts may present new questions. 

A Note About the Schedule

This project is self-paced. When you login to the Dashboard, you'll see an example timeline of due dates for each activitiy within the project. You may choose to follow this schedule, but it is completely optional. You are not penalized for not following this schedule.

This project is divided into 6 Dives. Each Dive will present a different layer of the application to build. The first Dive will introduce fundamental topics in Java programming that you'll need to know before actually building upon the project. You'll setup a Starter Kit in Dive 2 and from there, you'll add code to that kit to produce the final project. 

Final Notes

As a final note, have fun! You'll be learning new programming languages and techniques to employ when writing end-to-end web applications. You'll be able to take what you learn and build upon it in further levels or other outside projects. 

Happy Coding!
